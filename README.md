## What's this about?

This repo contains my notes and musings in topics of statistics. The notebooks contain my notes taken from various sources along with relevant source code and visualizations. To save time, I have not added any citations in any of my notes. However, you can find my recommendations and the books I read as references at the bottom of this document.

## Which parts of this repo can I reuse for my purposes?

Anything other than the notes - since most of them are probably not my words, rather a mixture of different standard texts and blog articles.

## Book recommendations

These are the books I used for learning various topics in Stats. Some are general while other are pretty niche. I thank [IIT Bombay's central library](https://www.library.iitb.ac.in/) for its sizeable collection of stats books.

1. _Statistics_ by James McClave & Terry Sincich (13th edition)
2. _Mathematical Statistics with Applications_ by KM Ramachandran & CP Tsokos
3. _Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python_ by Hastie et al.
4. _Elements of Statistical Learning_ by Hastie et al.
